## Introduction

### Title Slide
- **Title:** Moving Beyond p-values: The Power of Estimation Statistics
- **Subtitle:** A New Paradigm for Basic Science Research
- **Your Name, Title, Affiliation**
- **Date:** 2023-10-05

### Objectives
- Why p-values can be problematic
- Introduction to estimation statistics
- Practical examples
- Tools and resources for implementation

## Background

### The Problem with p-values
- Brief history of p-values in scientific research
- Common misconceptions (e.g., p < 0.05 means "significant")
- Pitfalls: p-hacking, multiple comparisons, and the replication crisis

### Misinterpretations and Limitations
- Examples where p-values have misled researchers
- The binary nature of p-values oversimplifies results

## Introduction to Estimation Statistics

### What is Estimation Statistics?
- Definition and key concepts:
  - Point estimates
  - Confidence intervals
  - Effect sizes

### Advantages Over p-values
- More information about the magnitude and precision of effects
- Encourages thinking about clinical or practical significance
- Helps in comparing and combining results from multiple studies

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Effect Size
- Real-world example where effect size provides more insight than a p-value
- Visual aids like forest plots or bar charts with confidence intervals

### Example 2: Confidence Intervals
- Confidence intervals give a range of plausible values for the estimate
- Interpretation: not just "does it include zero?"

## Implementing Estimation Statistics

### Tools and Software
- Overview of software and packages that support estimation statistics (e.g., R, Python, SPSS, JASP)
- Brief demo or screenshots of generating these statistics in R using packages like `effectsize` or `estimatr`

### Reporting and Interpretation
- Best practices for reporting estimation statistics in research papers
- How to interpret and discuss these results in the context of your research

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1
- Detailed walk-through of a published paper that used estimation statistics
- Highlight key findings and how they were reported

### Case Study 2
- Another example from a different field to show the versatility of estimation statistics

## Conclusion

### Summary
- Recap the key points covered
- Reinforce the benefits of using estimation statistics

### Future Directions
- Encourage the audience to start incorporating these methods in their research
- Mention any upcoming workshops, courses, or resources for further learning

### Q&A
- Open the floor for questions
- Provide your contact information for follow-up

## Additional Resources

### References and Further Reading
- List of key papers, books, and online resources
- Recommended software and tutorials

### Acknowledgments
- Acknowledge any collaborators or funding sources
