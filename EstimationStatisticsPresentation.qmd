# Introduction


## Objectives
- Why p-values can be problematic
- Introduction to estimation statistics
- Practical examples
- Tools and resources for implementation

# Background

## P-Values: A Compromise Measure

- Developed in the early 20th century to address practical decision-making in experimental data.
- Designed as a tool for hypothesis testing.
- Measures the probability of obtaining results as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- Current usage of the p-value combines the work of R.A. Fisher for assessing strength of evidence with Neyman and Pearson's ideas for making decisions

## Fisher's Contribution

- Introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in the early 20th century.
- Measures the probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
- Flexible, intuitive measure of evidence.


## Neyman-Pearson Framework

- Developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson.
- Focused on long-term error rates and decision-making under uncertainty.
- Defined two types of errors: Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative).
- Established fixed significance levels (e.g., 0.05) for hypothesis testing decisions.

## Interpretation of p-value

[@bajpai2021]

- Neyman-Pearson differs in that it declares "significant" or "not significant" with no distinction between values

## Example: Large Sample Size with Trivial Effect

- Study investigating whether a new educational program improves test scores.

- Large sample size: 10,000 students.

- Findings 
   - Average test score for program participants: 76.5
   - Average test score for non-participants: 76.0
- Calculated p-value: p = 0.001


## Misinterpretations and Limitations
- Examples where p-values have misled researchers
- The binary nature of p-values oversimplifies results

## Introduction to Estimation Statistics

### What is Estimation Statistics?
- Definition and key concepts:
  - Point estimates
  - Confidence intervals
  - Effect sizes

### Advantages Over p-values
- More information about the magnitude and precision of effects
- Encourages thinking about clinical or practical significance
- Helps in comparing and combining results from multiple studies

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Effect Size
- Real-world example where effect size provides more insight than a p-value
- Visual aids like forest plots or bar charts with confidence intervals

### Example 2: Confidence Intervals
- Confidence intervals give a range of plausible values for the estimate
- Interpretation: not just "does it include zero?"

## Implementing Estimation Statistics

### Tools and Software
- Overview of software and packages that support estimation statistics (e.g., R, Python, SPSS, JASP)
- Brief demo or screenshots of generating these statistics in R using packages like `effectsize` or `estimatr`

### Reporting and Interpretation
- Best practices for reporting estimation statistics in research papers
- How to interpret and discuss these results in the context of your research

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1
- Detailed walk-through of a published paper that used estimation statistics
- Highlight key findings and how they were reported

### Case Study 2
- Another example from a different field to show the versatility of estimation statistics

## Conclusion

### Summary
- Recap the key points covered
- Reinforce the benefits of using estimation statistics

### Future Directions
- Encourage the audience to start incorporating these methods in their research
- Mention any upcoming workshops, courses, or resources for further learning

### Q&A
